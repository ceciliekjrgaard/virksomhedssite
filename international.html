            We were truly blown away by DJ Simon. He was wonderful!! We had an amazing time! He really captured the mood of our party. The entire group danced all night. We would book him again for any party without hesitation. We are so grateful to
            DJ Simon for the ambiance he created. It really made the evening extremely special.

            We're writing to thank you for helping us with the music for our wedding and our reception. We booked 2 set-up's, 1 outside for the reception with lounge music and 1 inside for the party in the evening. Everything was done super
            professionally and Simon was really great!
